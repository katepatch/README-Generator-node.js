AS A developer</br>
I WANT a README generator</br>
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input</br>

THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions</br>
WHEN I enter my project title</br>
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README</br>
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions</br>
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests</br>
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options</br>
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under</br>
WHEN I enter my GitHub username</br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile</br>
